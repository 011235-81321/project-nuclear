  <p>Nuclear War. A constant threat to the entire world looming over our heads. Ever since nuclear weapons
  were created the world was constantly at threat. Evident through the attacks of Hiroshima
  and Nagasaki these weapons are capable of destruction far too great to be in human hands. And yet we have Thousands more.
   Currently the total amount of documented nuclear weapons is over 12,500 with the U.S. having 5,244 and Russia having 5,889.
  These two big world powers, that are in direct conflict with each other, are a big part in the constant threat of nuclear war. 
  Despite the striking nubmers and the rivaling countries no nuclear war has occured. This is because of mutually assured destruction.
  If even a small amount of the nuclear weapons that are currently stockpiled are released it can destroy the world as we know it.
  It is important to note however, that the earth's destruction would not result from the destructive power of the weapons themselves but the following nuclear fallout which would cripple society and surrounding ecosystems.
   This disturbing fact made the countries come to an agreement that they would never fire their weapons first and only in defense
    of someone attacking them with nuclear weapons. This has kept nuclear war at bay for the moment, but it also created this constant tension. That at any moment
  We could be hurled into a nuclear world War and cause the end of the world. While not as simple, the 
  issue still stands. This website's purpose is to spread awareness and help fund projects to get rid of nuclear weapons.
  Thankfully nuclear weapons have declined since their prime in the cold war but their still out their so I beleive it is our duty
  to put an end to them.

  <h1>Origins</h1>
  <p>The origins of nuclear weapons span back to september 12, 1933 when
     Leo szilárd thought about a possible chain reaction to release and
      harness the energy stored in atoms. Years later Lise Meitner realized
       the process she later coined “nuclear fission” with Uranium. After 
       this discovery however there began an increase in fear of Nazi
        Germany using this new found discovery to create nuclear weapons 
       due to their sudden stockpile of uranium. This led to the creation
       of the famous or infamous Manhattan Project Group which started 
      somewhere by the end of summer 1942. The Group[pictured above]
     (holding members such as the famous Oppenheimer and Albert
      Einstein among others) worked on this project till their 
      successful creation and devastating implementation on
      july 16 1945. This was when the first atomic bomb was tested.
      A little less than a month later on august 6, 1945 the nuclear
      warhead the Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima by the U.S. 
      with devastating effects. Instantly vaporizing
      the people in the vicinity and causing long term radiation
      poisoning for the people not in the immediate blast range.
      Then they would go on to use another on Nagasaki three
      days later. After World War II Russia was able 
      to create their own nuclear weapons witch thrust Russia and
      the U.S. into the cold war, due to their rivaling economic policies,
      in which due to fear of nuclear attack they would
      indirectly attack the other by supporting groups
     against them. Eventually this nuclear stockpile got so
    tremendously high, action needed to be taken. So they
    made a treaty to decrease
     the amount of nuclear warheads they had.</p>
